    "type": "Portfolio Project",
    "name": "Agent QA - Burger Index",
    "description": "Agent QA is an intelligent quality assurance system designed as a hybrid of in-house machine learning models and LLM-based agents, acting as a final validator across multiple AI-driven data pipelines for deduplication, matching, and data extraction, thereby reducing manual data verification efforts.",
    "tools": [
        "Python",
        "OpenAI",
        "GPT",
        "Gemini",
        "Scikit-learn",
        "Pandas",
        "NLP",
        "Computer Vision",
        "TensorFlow",
        "Keras"
    ],
    "role": [
        "Designed and trained multiple in-house machine learning models using previously tagged and labeled datasets, leveraging rule-based and NLP-driven systems to predict match confidence scores and flag low-confidence results for human review",
        "Developed multi-agent pipelines using OpenAI and Gemini agents to perform scenario-based analysis and incorporate additional features not used in the primary matching and tagging pipelines",
        "Built the complete Agent QA ecosystem and integrated it seamlessly into existing AI-powered data engineering workflows as a final quality control layer",
        "Implemented mechanisms to automatically identify and surface potential false positives for targeted human QA verification",
        "Reduced manual quality assurance efforts from hours of data verification to just minutes by introducing intelligent prioritization and agent-based validation"
