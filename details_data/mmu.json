  "name": "MMU-OCR-20",
  "description": "A complete solution for recognizing printed Urdu text in images, supporting multiple fonts. The research consisted of generating a benchmark dataset for printed Urdu using multiple fonts, along with Deep Neural network-based models that can recognize printed Urdu text lines and words regardless of the used font.",
  "tools": [
    "Python",
    "Polyglot",
    "Tensorflow 2.0 Keras API",
    "Numpy",
    "Pandas",
    "Pillow",
    "Sklearn",
    "H5py",
    "OpenCV",
    "Matplotlib"
  ],
  "role": [
    "Worked as the researcher, building up a complete set of rationale on what limitations of the current systems the said research overcomes",
    "Scrapped, cleansed, and formatted the data which was then used to generate the final corpus",
    "Build up state-of-the-art CNN and RNN-based DNN models for building up a complete OCR system",
    "Worked on the analysis of the dataset and the trained models"
