    "Python",
    "FastAPI",
    "Mistral",
    "Together.ai",

  "role": [
    "Built an end-to-end recommendation solution using GPT-4 to generate dynamic filters for extracting movie data from TMDB",
    "Applied NLP techniques to parse and normalize irregular LLM-generated outputs",
    "Evaluated and experimented with Mistral and LLaMA models to reduce dependency on GPT-4 and lower operational costs",
    "Implemented secure API key-based authentication for communication between the Reki application and the recommendation service"
