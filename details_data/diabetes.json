  "type": "Portfolio Project",
  "name": "Type 2 Diabetes Prediction Using Routine EHR Data",
  "description": "A disease prediction project using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to leverage patient medical history for predicting the likelihood of type 2 diabetes. The project identified novel features and created multiple machine and deep learning classifiers, along with a framework for early detection that outputs predictions with confidence scores.",
  "tools": [
    "Python",
    "NumPy",
    "Pandas",
    "scikit-learn",
    "TensorFlow (Keras)",
    "Matplotlib",
    "MS SQL Server"
  ],
  "role": [
    "Reviewed existing literature and disease prediction systems to design a solution using available patient data at CureMD",
    "Identified features suitable for predicting type 2 diabetes in the absence of direct lab results",
    "Designed a novel deep neural network architecture and a framework for quantifying prediction uncertainty",
    "Authored a research article based on the project for publication"
