  "description": "A Machine Learning-based smart customer service call quality control application to classify the sentiments of on-call clients and call operators, generating smart notifications for managers if intervention is required.",
  "tools": [
    "Python",
    "NLTK",
    "Tensorflow 2.0 Keras API",

  "role": [
    "Worked as the main researcher along with one other developer, identifying techniques and implementing them",
    "Developed tone analyzer for sentiment analysis using Tensorflow Keras, taking MFCC features of audio and passing them to a pre-trained CNN-based model trained on RAVEDESS and SAVEE datasets",
    "Built a Naïve Bayes-based model using NLTK trained on the IMDB dataset to classify sentiment from audio transcriptions generated via IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API",
    "Created a final model that weighted the sentiment for audio chunks based on results from both models to generate real-time quality control flags"
